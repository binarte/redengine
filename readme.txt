# Red Engine

Red Engine is a standalone engine based on the game Red Eclipse, intended to be easy to make a new project with. I
liked the graphical look of the game, so I decided to fork the engine to fit other projects.

Currently intended changes to be implemented:

 * Porting from SDL2 to SDL3
 * Splitscreen and multi monitor multiplayer
 * Gamepad support with gyro implementation
 * X86 platform removed, AARCH64 support to be added
 * Switch windows build from MSVC to Mingw-based
 * Epic Store connectivity support, maybe with GOG added down the road
 * Localization improvements

## Open Source

The project is Free and Open Source, meaning that you can both use it for free and be a part of it
    by contributing in whatever way you can. These are the people who have helped shape Red Eclipse
    into what you see today. They are regular people just like you who volunteer their time or
    donate in the spirit of making a really cool game. Your name could be down here, too!

## Red Eclipse Credits

The below list acknowledges the efforts of the developers of Red Eclipse. Red Engine is an independent fork project not
endorsed by the original developers of the game.
